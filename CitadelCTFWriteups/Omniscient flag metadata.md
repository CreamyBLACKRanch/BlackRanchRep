# Omniscient flag metadata
Flag: `citadel{th1s_ch4ll3ng3_1s_f0r_th4t_0n3_ex1ft00l_4nd_b1nw4lk_enthus14st}`

### Solve
We first ran `exiftool` on the image, so then we get a hint that another image is hidden within the image.<br>
We upload that image in an online binwalk tool, from that we get png file which shows the flag.
