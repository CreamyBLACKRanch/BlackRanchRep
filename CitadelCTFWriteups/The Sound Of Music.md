# The Sound of Music

Flag `citadel{c0mputers_st0pped_exchang1ng_1nf0rmat10n_n_started_shar1ng_st0r1es_n_then_they_were_n0where_t0_be_f0und}`

### Solve
We google `citadweller` and find his rateyourmusic profile, which has one part of the flag, there is link in his bio which leads to a spotify playlist by `citadweller`, which has another part of the flag.
<br>We check music sites like soundcloud, youtube music to look for `citadweller`, we finally find another part of the flag in his last.fm account.
<br> We combine the three to get the flag.
